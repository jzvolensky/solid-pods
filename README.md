# Exploring Solid Pods

The starting point of this project is the getting started guide by Inrupt available [here](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/getting-started/)

## Current functionality
- Support for login
- Uploading data to pod in text box form or as a file directly

  **(Do note that this is currently only possible to hardcoded locations)**
  

## Setup and local development

To install the necessary requirements go to root and execute:

```sh
npm install
```

To compile webpack and view your creation:

```sh
npm run build && npm run start

```
